### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data from Scratch: NSFetchedResultsController

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the previous installments of this series, we covered the fundamentals of the Core Data framework. It's time we put our knowledge to use by building a simple application powered by Core Data. In this tutorial, we'll also meet another star player of the Core Data framework, the NSFetchedResultsController class. The application that we're about to create manages a list of to-do items. With the application, we can add, update, and delete to-do items. You'll quickly learn that the NSFetchedResultsController class makes this very easy to do.
